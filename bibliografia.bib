Using these new tools, we are able to give two new characterizations for a group to be virtually free. Furthermore, we prove that the Baumslag-Solitar group \${BS}(1,n)\$ is \$k\$-chordal for some \$k\$ if and only if \${\textbar}n{\textbar}{\textless}3\$ and we give an application of generalized chordality to the study of the word problem.},

We prove our conjecture for several classes of soluble groups, including metabelian groups and torsion-free soluble groups, and present progress towards resolving the conjecture for soluble groups in general. Some of the techniques introduced for proving languages not to be poly-context-free may be of independent interest.},

Namely, we prove that a finitely generated, infinite group is virtually free if and only if for any finite generating set, the corresponding Cayley graph is minor excluded. This answers a question of Ostrovskii and Rosenthal. The proof relies on showing that a finitely generated group that is minor excluded with respect to every finite generating set is accessible, using a graph-theoretic characterisation of accessibility due to Thomassen and Woess.},

	abstract = {The word problem of a finitely generated group is the formal language of words over the generators which are equal to the identity in the group. If this language happens to be context-free, then the group is called context-free. Finitely generated virtually free groups are context-free. In a seminal paper Muller and Schupp showed the converse: A context-free group is virtually free. Over the past decades a wide range of other characterizations of context-free groups have been found. The present notes survey most of these characterizations. Our aim is to show how the different characterizations of context-free groups are interconnected. Moreover, we present a self-contained access to the Muller-Schupp theorem without using Stallings' structure theorem or a separate accessibility result. We also give an introduction to some classical results linking groups with formal language theory.},
